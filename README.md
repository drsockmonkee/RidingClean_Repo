Learning how not to be a caveman.

I've been working in GIS for over  20 yrs, and have been doing web development (learning) for a little while (2+) yrs, before that 
VB, C#, for extensions to the ESRI Desktop softwares  

Like many people coming into the coding world from GIS, I work alone ('hey, we need a button' says the boss)
and do not have much formal training.  My degrees are all in GIS / PolySci but have been coding as a way to answer 
questions and make my work easier and answer my boss' questions.

I began web dev as a way to get geospatial work out to the decision makers and consumers of the information/analysis
and at first just wanted things to 'work', but knew there was more.

I was able recently to attend the ESRI Dev Summit and hear two really good presentations on being a better coder.

Dillon (from SitePen) was kind enough to introduce me to the Configurable Map Viewer  
here at : https://github.com/cmv/cmv-app

This is my attempt to both more fully understand 'dojo / javascriptin' to become a better developer.
